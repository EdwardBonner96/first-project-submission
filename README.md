# Didcot Film Club 

## Purpose of the Project
The Didcot Film Club website is a site that hopes to encourage local users to meet regularly to watch and review films. The site will be targeted towards film-goers looking to socialise and meet other similarly interested people. The site will be useful for current and prospective members to see when the next meeting is and will allow new users to be added to a mailing list. 

## Existing Features and User Stories

 - The fully responsive navigation bar links to the main sections of the website and stays in place at the top of the site for ease of navigation.
 - This will allow the user to easily navigate the website on any device.
 - The navigation bar also features the title, making it obvious which location this site is applicable to.

### The Landing Page Image
